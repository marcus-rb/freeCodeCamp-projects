                <li>
                    <strong>1917</strong><p> - born in Brookline, Massachussets</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1940</strong><p> - graduated Harvard University, and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1943</strong><p> - commanded a gunboat in WW2 designated <span class="non-break">PT-109,</span> which was
                        incapacitated by the Japanese. As a result of JFK's actions after the wreckage he was 
                        awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest obtainable non-combative award. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1947</strong><p> - elected into the House of Representatives, which a staggering 42 percent of the 
                        vote, competing against ten other candidates. As a congressman he worked for better housing for veterans,
                        stronger overall healthcare, as well as better workers rights. He also expressed a wish for peace through
                        the United Nations and a clear anti-soviet stance. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1953</strong><p> - elected as Massachussets senator. In this period up until his period as president
                        he fell seriously ill several times, at several points being given Catholic last rites. During his recovery
                        he published the book <i>Profiles in Courage</i>, a book about heroic and integral acts by eight US Senators, which he 
                        won a pulitzer price for. Most of his politics was state-focused, with bills sponsoring fishing, textile manufacturing,
                        and watchmaking industries.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1960</strong><p> - inagurated as 35th President of the United States. In his inaguration speech he famously
                        said "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." Moreover, the 
                        president implied wishes for greater international co-operation to fight "the common enemies of man: tyranny,
                        poverty, disease, and war itself."
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1962</strong><p> - resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis. CIA spy planes discovered that the CCCP was placing
                        nuclear missiles on Cuba, thus placing the US in immedate danger if an attack where to take place. This placed a 
                        dilemma in JFK's lap as it could easily seem like an attack on the missile sites would leat to nuclear war, and 
                        inaction would weaken and threathen the US significantly. A naval quarantine was put in place to inspect all ships arriving
                        and leaving Cuba. On October 28 Kruschchev, the Soviet Leader, agreed to dismantle the missile sites, and the US promised to
                        never invade Cuba, as well as agreeing in private to remove US missile sites in Turkey and Italy. The latter were obsolete
                        anyways, as they were replaced with submarines carrying newer more capable missiles. After the crisis JFK's approval 
                        ratings rose from an already high 66% to 77%.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1963</strong><p> - assassinated. Officially JFK was shot and killed by previous US Marine, and also defector to 
                        the CCCP, Lee Harvey Oswald. Little is known about his motives for killing the president, as he was shot only one 
                        day after the assassination by night-club owner Jack Ruby. As many as 61% of Americans still believed in a conspiracy
                        according to a 2013 Gallup poll. It may not be unlikely to think, as many of his policies faced strong opposition,
                        especially his attempts to pass the Civil Rights Act. Famous civil rights activist Martin Luther King was also
                        assassinated in this time period. His assassination in turn allowed his successor Lyndon B Johnson
                        to pass the act, with the memory of the late president still fresh in mind. In the end JFK was rated 3rd on a list of
                        the 20th century's most admired people, only behind Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Theresa.
