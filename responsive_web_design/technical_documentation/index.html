                <p>C++ is a general purpose programming language created as an extension of the C language. It is most often implemented as a compiled language. Techincally C++ is a high level language which features
                    low level memory management, but it is not uncommon to refer to it as either "mid level" or low level when comparing it to languages with more overhead, like JavaScript or Python.
                     It is perhaps most famous today for its possibility for high performance and thus usage in video game development and other task intensive time critical applications.

                reveals that 23% of developers had used C++ in the last 12 months, and 4% reported they we're planning to adopt it.

                <p>The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, began working on "C with Classes" in 1979. The language was created because Stroustrup
                    wanted to integrate features from languages he found useful, but not strong enough on their own. He wanted the features of Simula with the speed of BCPL.
                    Stroustrup chose C as his 
                    basis because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and already in widespread use. C++ was officially created in 1982, as an updated version of "C with Classes."
                    The increment operator, ++, was appended to the name as C++ was the natural evolution of C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ has been on a three-year update schedule ever since 2011, with three previous updates; C++03, C++98 and C++2.0.
                    The 1998-release was the first standardized version, bringing C++ into the ISO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Development of the C++ language follows a philosophy construed by a set of principles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>C++ must be driven by actual problems, and features should be immediately useful.</li>
                        <li>Every feature should be implementable in a reasonably obvious manner</li>
                        <li>Programmers should be able to freely pick any programming style, and have that style supported by C++</li>
                        <li>Allowing useful features take priority over preventing misuse of the language</li>
                        <li>C++ should provide facilities for organizing and creating code in separate and well-defined parts, as well as tools for joing those parts together</li>
                        <li>There should be no implicit violations of the type system</li>
                        <li>User created types must have the same support and performance as built-in types</li>
                        <li>Unused features should not affect performance negatively</li>
                        <li>There should be no language beneath C++, except for platform specific assembly language.</li>
                        <li>C++ should work alongside other programming languages, and not foster its own incompatible environment</li>
                        <li>If the programmer's intent is unknown, the programmer should be able to specify it via manual control</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>C++ is considered a superset of C, as all valid C-code is also valid C++ code. C#, although having a similar name is built 
                    on a different principle, and has features like garbage-collection that would violate C and C++'s fundamental principles about
                user-control. C# is a younger language, and besides syntax shares little with C and C++. C# is also mostly just used on Windows, while
            C and C++ can run in any environment that offers a suitable compiler. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
                <header>
                    <h1>Hello World</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    C++ can be quite the complex language to learn, especially if programming is new to you. To demonstrate this we can look at 
                    a common way to write the "Hello World!" program:
                </p>
                <code class="block-code">
                    #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
                    <br>
                    int main() {<br>
                    <pre>    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; std::endl;<br></pre>
                    <pre>    return 0;<br></pre>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>Let's start at the top. <code>#include</code> is a pre-processor directive that takes whatever file comes after
                and simply pastes the file in place. Yes, <code>iostream</code> is a file without an extension. The angle brackets are
            typically used to tell the editor that the given file is to be found in the pre-processors include path. That would make sense
            when we're using a <i>standard library header</i>, like iostream. You can also create your own header files and use normal double quotes
            to include a file from a relative path. This also introduced us to the C++ pre-processor, which is what runs before the compiler.</p> 
            <p>
                So, what's up with <code>int main()</code>? Well, all C++ programs require a point of entry, the entry function. Usually
                this is preset as <code>main</code>. Some editors let you pick your own entry function. The <code>int</code> part signifies
                the return type of the function, and will be the exit code of our program. The last function to stop executing given proper 
                crash free execution is always the entry function, so setting up various return statements given conditions can help with debugging
                and understanding how our program executed. 0 is usually picked as the default success code, and thus we also have a 
                <code>return 0;</code> statement before the end of our function. Some compilers will allow you to omit the return statement for 
                cleaner code. This does not mean that it is not there, but the compiler puts it there for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so now the line we haven't spoken about. There's a lot more to unpack here. First, let's take a look at <code>std::cout &lt;&lt;</code>. 
                Here we have a function call. Yes, not exactly an intuitive syntax. First we are accessing the <i>namespace</i> called 
                <code>std</code>, using the name and the <i>namespace access operator.</i> That would be the two colons. Inside <code>std</code> we
                call the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator on the <code>cout</code> class. Think of operators as functions. C++ supports operator overloading, so 
                this bitshift operator now functions as the <i>insertion operator</i>. The text-string <code>"Hello World!"</code> is actually the function argument. Next comes 
                another insertion operator. Imagine this as chaining functions like you would normally do with a <code>.someFunc()</code>. <code>std::endl</code> is an object 
                also in the std namespace that does some things to the current iostream, like flushing the stream and performing a carriage return. As you might understand, you can take
                a deep dive into any line here and be stuck for a few hours. This complexity is what turns some people off, but is also what allows a really competent programmer to
                create lightning fast code. So, here's a statement by statement explanation of the "Hello World!"-program:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code">
                #include &lt;iostream&gt; //copies the file 'iostream' into the document.
                <br>
                <br>
                int main() { //start of definition of our main-function, the point where the program will start execution.
                <pre>   std::cout &lt;&lt; //call "&lt;&lt;" on cout in the std namespace.</pre>
                <pre>   "Hello World!" &lt;&lt; //pass "Hello World!" as the argument, and make another call to "&lt;&lt"</pre>
                <pre>   std::endl; //pass 'endl' as argument, and terminate expression with semi-colon</pre>
                <br>
                <pre>   return 0; //return 0 as program exit code</pre>
                } //end of definition of main-function
            </code>

                    <h1>Language features</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    As C++ has grown in the 21st century a lot of modern features have been added. This does not subtract from the basic language features. The syntax
                    of C++ is very similar to that of C, as most of it is inherited. In c++ objects can have static, thread or dynamic storage durations. The user determines
                    this manually. All objects not created thread level or dynamically are static storage objects. C++ also supports block level storage, which falls under
                    the category of automatic storage duration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ supports classes providing all four features commonly present in object oriented programming languages: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance
                    and polymorphism. C++ also distinguishes itself from other languages by supporting deterministic destructors. C++ abstraction can be done in pretty 
                    much any way the user sees fit, and the great support for operator overloading makes the case that user-built types can behave and perform on the level
                    of built-in types.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Templates">
                <header>
                    <h1>Templates</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    A feature C++ is famous for is the template feature. It is easily distunguished by the use of the <code>template</code> keyword, often followed by one or more
                    template arguments in angle brackets. Templates are highly useful for generic programming. Instead of overloading a function to fit several data types, 
                    a template will often suffice, keeping the code clean. Templates are compiled and cannot be passed dynamic objects as arguments as this would make the impossible
                    to determine in static computation. This means that you cannot send template arguments out of an if-statement that cannot be determined at compile-time. Here is an
                    example of a template function that deallocates dynamic memory:
                </p>
                <code class="block-code">
                    template &lt;typename T&gt;<br>
                    void deallocate(T* ptr, size_t amount = 1) {
                    <pre>   ::operator delete((void*)ptr, sizeof(T)*amount);</pre>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>the <code>deallocate</code> function template takes one template argument: T, the type. The function then uses the type to determine
                how much memory should be freed. For example, deallocating four <code>int</code>s frees more space than four <code>char</code>s, with a respective
            size of 4 and 1 byte. Calling <code>deallocate&lt;int&gt;(&myIntegers, 2)</code> would at compile-time generate the same function with the expression <code>sizeof(T)</code> replaced with <code>sizeof(int)</code>,
        which of course is 4. Then our arguments would be passed in. In this case <code>&myIntegers</code> gets us the memory address of <code>myIntegers</code>, a two-integer array. The appropriate call 
        is made to <code>::operator delete</code>, and our memory is released. <i>Note that it in most cases is easier to use the <code>delete[]</code> keyword to release memory. This function
        was written as part of creating a custom memory allocator for automatic garbage collection.</i>

                <p>
                    C++'s object oriented aspects allow for common polymorphism through inheritance, both private, public and protected. In addition to this functions 
                    can be overloaded to take and return different arguments and types while still keeping their name. Template programming uses this feature. You can 
                    also assign any type to any set of data you have the address of, as types are not strictly enforced. This is referred to as type punning.

                    The C++ standard consists of both the core language and the standard library. Most expect to find the standard library included in any major implementation
                    of C++. The C++ standard library is quite extensive and provides 105 standard headers. 27 are deprecated.
