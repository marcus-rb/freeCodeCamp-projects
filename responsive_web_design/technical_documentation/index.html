                <p>C++ is a general purpose programming language created as an extension of the C language. Originally it was called "C with Classes,"
                    but as more features were integrated C++ was chosen as the name. It is most often implemented as a compiled language. It is a high-level language, but does also facilite low-level 
                memory manipulation. It is perhaps most famous today for its possibility for high performance and thus usage in video game development.
                </p><p>
                This documentation provides basic information about C++, and you should have a general understanding of programming to get the most out of the content.

                <p>The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, began working on "C with Classes" in 1979. The language was created because Stroustrup
                    wanted to integrate features from languages he found useful, but not strong enough on their own, especially Simula, which was 
                    good for large software development, but too slow, and BCPL, which was fast, but too low-level. Stroustrup chose C as his 
                    basis as it was general-purpose, fast, portable and already in wide use. C++ was created in 1982, as an updated version of "C with Classes."
                    The name was chosen as "++" is in C as with many other languages the increment operator: C++ was the next step up from C. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ has been on a three-year update schedule ever since 2011, and has had three stable releases after the original version; C++03, C++98 and C++2.0.
                    The 1998-release was the first standardized version, under a specific ISO group. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further development of the C++ language follows a guiding philosophy, which consits of a set of principles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It must be driven by actual problems, and features should be immediately useful.</li>
                        <li>Every feature should be implementable</li>
                        <li>Programmers should be able to freely pick any programming style, and have that style supported by C++</li>
                        <li>Allowing useful features take priority over preventing misuse of the language</li>
                        <li>It should provide facilities for organizing and creating code in separate and well-defined parts, as well as tools for joing said parts together</li>
                        <li>There should be no implicit violations of the type system</li>
                        <li>User created types must have the same support and performance as built-in types</li>
                        <li>Unused features should not affect performance negatively</li>
                        <li>There should be no language beneath C++, except for platform specific assembly language.</li>
                        <li>C++ should work alongside other programming languages, and not foster its own incompatible environment</li>
                        <li>If the programmer's intent is unknown, the programmer should be able to specify it via manual control</li>
                    </ul>

                </header>
                <p>C++ is considered a superset of C, as all valid C-code is also valid C++ code. C#, although having a similar name is built 
                    on a different principle, and has features like garbage-collection that would violate C and C++'s fundamental principles about
                user-control. C# is a younger language, and besides syntax shares little with C and C++. C# is also mostly just used on Windows, while
            C and C++ can run in any environment that offers a suitable compiler. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
                <header>
                    <h1>Hello World</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    C++ can be quite the complex language to learn, especially if programming is new to you. To demonstrate this we can look at 
                    a common way to write the "Hello World!" program:
                </p>
                <code class="block-code">
                    #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
                    <br>
                    int main() {<br>
                    <pre>    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; std::endl;<br></pre>
                    <pre>    return 0;<br></pre>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>Let's start at the top. <code>#include</code> is a pre-processor directive that takes whatever file comes after
                and simply pastes the file in place. Yes, <code>iostream</code> is a file without an extension. The angle brackets are
            typically used to tell the editor that the given file is to be found in the pre-processors include path. That would make sense
            when we're using a <i>standard library header</i>, like iostream. You can also create your own header files and use normal double quotes
            to include a file from a relative path. This also introduced us to the C++ pre-processor, which is what runs before the compiler.</p> 
            <p>
                So, what's up with <code>int main()</code>? Well, all C++ programs require a point of entry, the entry function. Usually
                this is preset as <code>main</code>. Some editors let you pick your own entry function. The <code>int</code> part signifies
                the return type of the function, and will be the exit code of our program. The last function to stop executing given proper 
                crash free execution is always the entry function, so setting up various return statements given conditions can help with debugging
                and understanding how our program executed. 0 is usually picked as the default success code, and thus we also have a 
                <code>return 0;</code> statement before the end of our function. Some compilers will allow you to omit the return statement for 
                cleaner code. This does not mean that it is not there, but the compiler puts it there for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay so now the line we haven't spoken about. There's a lot more to unpack here. First, let's take a look at <code>std::cout &lt;&lt;</code>. 
                Here we have a function call. Yes, not exactly an intuitive syntax. First we are accessing the <i>namespace</i> called 
                <code>std</code>, using the name and the <i>namespace access operator.</i> That would be the two colons. Inside <code>std</code> we
                call the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator on the <code>cout</code> class. Think of operators as functions. C++ supports operator overloading, so 
                this bitshift operator now functions as the <i>insertion operator</i>. The text-string <code>"Hello World!"</code> is actually the function argument. Next comes 
                another insertion operator. Imagine this as chaining functions like you would normally do with a <code>.someFunc()</code>. <code>std::endl</code> is an object 
                also in the std namespace that does some things to the current iostream, like flushing the stream and performing a carriage return. As you might understand, you can take
                a deep dive into any line here and be stuck for a few hours. This complexity is what turns some people off, but is also what allows a really competent programmer to
                create lightning fast code. So, here's a statement by statement explanation of the "Hello World!"-program:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code">
                #include &lt;iostream&gt; //copies the file 'iostream' into the document.
                <br>
                <br>
                int main() { //start of definition of our main-function, the point where the program will start execution.
                <pre>   std::cout &lt;&lt; //call "&lt;&lt;" on cout in the std namespace.</pre>
                <pre>   "Hello World!" &lt;&lt; //pass "Hello World!" as the argument, and make another call to "&lt;&lt"</pre>
                <pre>   std::endl; //pass 'endl' as argument, and terminate expression with semi-colon</pre>
                <br>
                <pre>   return 0; //return 0 as program exit code</pre>
                } //end of definition of main-function
            </code>
