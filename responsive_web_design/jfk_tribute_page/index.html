                <p id="img-caption">After joining the United States Naval Reserve Kennedy worked his way up to the rank of first lieutenant. On April 24 1943
                    he took command of PT-109, a gunboat in Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO. Later that year his boat was rammed by a Japanese
                    destroyer, killing two of his crewmates. Kennedy's actions after the event earned him the Navy and Marine Crops Medal,
                    the highest award given for non-combat actions. He is credited with saving his entire crew from starvation, and swam several
                    miles towing an injured crewmate, while at the same time suffering from a back injury that resurfaced after the inital crash.

                <h2>1961, January 20th - Inaguration</h2>
                <p>Kennedy begun his political career in the house of representatives in 1947. In 1953, he ran for and won the position of 
                    Massachussets senator. In 1960 he ran for president, and challenged amongst others his future vice president Lyndon B. Johnson.
                    After an exciting race to nomination, Kennedy won and faced Richard Nixon from the GOP, whom he won against with 303 to 219
                    electoral votes, and a meager two-tenths of a percentage point lead in the popular vote. He was inagurated on January 20th, 1961,
                    and famously said "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." He continued with an appeal
                    to internationalism and asked for accountability regarding strength and sacrifice.
